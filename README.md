Air Drawing Application

Overview

This is an air drawing application that allows users to draw in the air using their index finger, tracked by a webcam. The program utilizes OpenCV for real-time image processing, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and NumPy for handling image data. Users can switch between different colors, clear the canvas, and draw freely—without touching a screen.
